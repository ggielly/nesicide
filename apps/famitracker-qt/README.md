# FamiTracker Qt

This project is fork of FamiTracker CX written by Dan Spencer (nukep).

## What is FamiTracker Qt?
FamiTracker Qt is a free cross-platform Qt fork of FamiTracker for Linux.

FamiTracker Qt is created in order to bring the popular NES/Famicom music
tracker to Linux.

ALSA is the one supported audio API.

The software license is mixed GPL v2/New BSD (inherited from FamiTracker CX).

## Attention
FamiTracker Qt is not the main project I maintain. The code may contain errors. That's ok :)

## TODO
- [ ] Remove boost thread dependency 
- [ ] Fix crashes
- [ ] Write wav converter

## How to build
FamiTracker Qt depends on following libraries:
 * Qt5
 * libalsa-devel
 * boost-system
 * boost-thread

You can build boost libraries with for example [this](https://github.com/jslick/matrixvm/wiki/How-to-build-boost-thread-(on-Linux)) guide.

Once you resolve dependencies move to src folder and edit variable **BOOST_DIR** in *famitracker-qt.pro*.
Finally go to the project folder and type in the terminal the next commands:
```
mkdir build
cd build
qmake ../src/famitracker-qt.pro
make
```
